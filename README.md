# SPOT: StepwisePSO-based Package for Optimization of Targeted Process Simulation

**Optimization of membrane-assisted methanol synthesis using SPOT: A machine learning-based closed-loop framework**  


**SPOT** (StepwisePSO-based Package for Optimization of Targeted process simulation) is a novel machine learning-based closed-loop framework designed for optimizing membrane-assisted methanol synthesis. The framework integrates **predictive modeling, feature importance analysis, and a stepwise particle swarm optimization (stepwisePSO) algorithm** to refine process parameters efficiently.
