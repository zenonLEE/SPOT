**SPOT** (StepwisePSO-based Package for Optimization of Targeted process simulation) is a novel machine learning-based closed-loop framework designed for optimizing membrane-assisted methanol synthesis. The framework integrates **predictive modeling, feature importance analysis, and a stepwise particle swarm optimization (stepwisePSO) algorithm** to refine process parameters efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters
The `config/config.yaml` file contains key hyperparameters and settings. Modify the following parameters as needed:

- **Variable Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as `per_H2O1`, `per_S1`, `Fp1`, `T0`, and `P0` to optimize performance.
- **Model Settings**: Change `model_name`, `input_columns`, and `output_columns` as required.
- **Data Path**: Update `data_path` to specify the dataset location.
- **Optimization Settings**: Modify iteration counts and optimization strategies.
- **PSO Parameters**: Adjust `num_particles`, `max_iter`, `mutation_probability`, and other hyperparameters for tuning.
- **Random Seed**: Set `seed` for reproducibility.

Refer to `config/config.yaml` for detailed configurations.
